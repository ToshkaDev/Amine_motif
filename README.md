# Amine_motif
Data accompanying the paper on amine binding receptors 

We defined the amine binding motif as follows:

[YWF] x (~20-34) [WYF] [WYF] x (~20-25) [MLIVAC] x [ST] x (~17-21) D

Multiple sequence alignments built using NCBI RefSeq sequences corresponding to the amine binding receptors are in the **Alignment** folder. The positions corresponding to the amine motif in the _NCBI_RefSeq_Bacteria_Archaea.fa_ file are as follows:

[YWF] (**534**) x (~20-34) [WYF] [WYF] (**713**) x (~20-25) [MLIVAC] (**896**) x [ST] (**905**) x (~17-21) D (**979**)

The modeled structures of the amine receptors tested in the paper are in the **Structures** folder.

The bayesian phylogenetic tree and the multiple sequence alignment used are in the **Phylogeny** folder.
